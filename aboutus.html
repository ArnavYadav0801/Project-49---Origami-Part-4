<li>Origami, the art of paper folding, is one of the activities that kids enjoy a lot. It is associated with Japanese culture.The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper.
    Origami can be a great way to teach students and give them ideas about different shapes, figures, and sizes. Children can learn about maths at home through fun activities that inspire conversations about numbers, geometry, and spatial relations. The same sheet of paper can look completely different depending on where and how it is folded.
